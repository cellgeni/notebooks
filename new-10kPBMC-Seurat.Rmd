title: "Seurat tutorial using 10k PBMCs dataset"
output: html_document
---

This vignette should introduce you to some typical tasks, using Seurat eco-system. Seurat vignettes are available [here](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/get_started.html). An alternative to this vignette in Python (using scanpy) is also available in the same repository. The interconversion and exploration of datasets from Python to Seurat (and SCE) is described in a separate vignette. Let's install the packages currently missing in a default JupyterHub environment. 

Only run the chunk below if you're running the code for the first time, and do not have the packages installed.

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github('chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder')
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("celldex")
BiocManager::install("SingleR")
BiocManager::install("glmGamPoi")
```

Let's now load all the libraries that will be needed for the tutorial.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(Seurat)
library(DropletUtils)
library(ggplot2)
library(DoubletFinder)
library(SingleR)
library(dplyr)
library(celldex)
library(knitr)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

### PART 1. Basic quality control and filtering.

We start the analysis after two preliminary steps have been completed: 1) ambient RNA correction using soupX; 2) doublet detection using scrublet. Both vignettes can be found in this repository. 

To start the analysis, let's read in the corrected matrices:

```{r}
adj.matrix <- Read10X("../data/soupX_pbmc10k_filt")
```

After this, we will make a `Seurat` object. Seurat object summary shows us that 1) number of cells ("samples") approximately matches 
the description of each dataset (10194); 2) there are 36601 genes (features) in the reference.

```{r}
srat <- CreateSeuratObject(adj.matrix,project = "pbmc10k") 
srat
```

Let's look at the combined object a bit closer. Str allows us to see all fields of the class:

```{r}
str(srat)
```

Meta.data is the most important field for next steps. It can be acessed using both @ and [[]] operators. Right now it has 3 fields per celL: dataset ID, number of UMI reads detected per cell (nCount_RNA), and the number of expressed (detected) genes per same cell (nFeature_RNA). 

```{r}
meta <- srat@meta.data
dim(meta)
head(meta)
summary(meta$nCount_RNA)
summary(meta$nFeature_RNA)
```

Let's add several more values useful in diagnostics of cell quality. Michochondrial genes are useful indicators of cell state. For mouse datasets, change pattern to "Mt-", or explicitly list gene IDs with the _features = ..._ option.

```{r}
srat[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(srat, pattern = "^MT-")
```

Similarly, we can define ribosomal proteins (their names begin with __RPS__ or __RPL__), which often take substantial fraction of reads: 

```{r}
srat[["percent.rb"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(srat, pattern = "^RP[SL]")
```

Now, let's add the doublet annotation generated by `scrublet` to the Seurat object metadata. 

```{r}
doublets <- read.table("../data/scrublet_calls.tsv",header = F,row.names = 1)
colnames(doublets) <- c("Doublet_score","Is_doublet")
srat <- AddMetaData(srat,doublets)
head(srat[[]])
```

Let's make violin plots of the selected metadata features. Note that the plots are grouped by categories named identity class.
Identity class can be seen in srat@active.ident, or using `Idents()` function. Active identity can be changed using `SetIdents()`. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
VlnPlot(srat, features = c("nFeature_RNA","nCount_RNA","percent.mt","percent.rb"),ncol = 4) & 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

Let's plot some of the metadata features against each other and see how they correlate. The number above each plot is a Pearson correlation coefficient.

```{r fig.align="center"}
FeatureScatter(srat, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "percent.mt")
FeatureScatter(srat, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "nFeature_RNA")
FeatureScatter(srat, feature1 = "nCount_RNA", feature2 = "percent.rb")
FeatureScatter(srat, feature1 = "percent.rb", feature2 = "percent.mt")
FeatureScatter(srat, feature1 = "nFeature_RNA", feature2 = "Doublet_score")
```

The plots above clearly show that high MT percentage strongly correlates with low UMI counts, and usually is interpreted as dead cells. 
High ribosomal protein content, however, strongly anti-correlates with MT, and seems to contain biological signal. There's also a strong correlation between the doublet score and number of expressed genes. 

Let's set QC column in metadata and define it in an informative way. 

```{r}
srat[['QC']] <- ifelse(srat@meta.data$Is_doublet == 'True','Doublet','Pass')
srat[['QC']] <- ifelse(srat@meta.data$nFeature_RNA < 500 & srat@meta.data$QC == 'Pass','Low_nFeature',srat@meta.data$QC)
srat[['QC']] <- ifelse(srat@meta.data$nFeature_RNA < 500 & srat@meta.data$QC != 'Pass' & srat@meta.data$QC != 'Low_nFeature',paste('Low_nFeature',srat@meta.data$QC,sep = ','),srat@meta.data$QC)
srat[['QC']] <- ifelse(srat@meta.data$percent.mt > 15 & srat@meta.data$QC == 'Pass','High_MT',srat@meta.data$QC)
srat[['QC']] <- ifelse(srat@meta.data$nFeature_RNA < 500 & srat@meta.data$QC != 'Pass' & srat@meta.data$QC != 'High_MT',paste('High_MT',srat@meta.data$QC,sep = ','),srat@meta.data$QC)
table(srat[['QC']])
```

We can see that doublets don't often overlap with cell with low number of detected genes; at the same time, the latter often co-insides with high mitochondrial content. Let's plot metadata only for cells that pass tentative QC: 

```{r fig.align="center"}
VlnPlot(subset(srat, subset = QC == 'Pass'), 
        features = c("nFeature_RNA", "nCount_RNA", "percent.mt","percent.rb"), ncol = 4) & 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

### PART 2. Normalization and dimensionality reduction.

In order to do further analysis, we need to normalize the data to account for sequencing depth. Conventional way is to scale it to 10,000 (as if all cells have 10k UMIs overall), and log2-transform the obtained values. Normalized data are stored in `srat[['RNA']]@data` of the 'RNA' assay. 
```{r}
srat <- NormalizeData(srat)
```

Next step discovers the most variable features (genes) - these are usually most interesting for downstream analysis. 

```{r}
srat <- FindVariableFeatures(srat, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)
```

Identify the 10 most highly variable genes:

```{r}
top10 <- head(VariableFeatures(srat), 10)
top10 
```

Plot variable features with and without labels:

```{r fig.align="center",warning=FALSE}
plot1 <- VariableFeaturePlot(srat)
LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE, xnudge = 0, ynudge = 0)
```

ScaleData converts normalized gene expression to Z-score (values centered at 0 and with variance of 1). It's stored in srat[['RNA']]@scale.data and used in following PCA. Default is to run scaling only on variable genes.

```{r}
all.genes <- rownames(srat)
srat <- ScaleData(srat, features = all.genes)
```

We can now do PCA, which is a common way of linear dimensionality reduction. By default we use 2000 most variable genes. 

```{r}
srat <- RunPCA(srat, features = VariableFeatures(object = srat))
```

Prinicpal component "loadings" should match markers of distinct populations for well behaved datasets. Note that you can change many plot parameters using ggplot2 features - passing them with & operator. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
VizDimLoadings(srat, dims = 1:9, reduction = "pca") & 
  theme(axis.text=element_text(size=5), axis.title=element_text(size=8,face="bold"))
```

Alternatively, one can do heatmap of each principal component or several PCs at once: 

```{r fig.align="center"}
DimHeatmap(srat, dims = 1:6, nfeatures = 20, cells = 500, balanced = T)
```

DimPlot is used to visualize all reduced representations (PCA, tSNE, UMAP, etc). Identity is still set to "orig.ident". DimPlot has built-in hiearachy of dimensionality reductions it tries to plot: first, it looks for UMAP, then (if not available) tSNE, then PCA. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
DimPlot(srat, reduction = "pca")
```

It's often good to find how many PCs can be used without much information loss. In our case a big drop happens at 10, so seems like a good _initial_ choice: 

```{r fig.align="center"}
ElbowPlot(srat)
```

We can now do clustering. Higher resolution leads to more clusters (default is 0.8). It would be very important to find the correct cluster resolution in the future, since cell type markers depends on cluster definition. 

```{r}
srat <- FindNeighbors(srat, dims = 1:10)
srat <- FindClusters(srat, resolution = 0.5)
```

For visualization purposes, we also need to generate UMAP reduced dimensionality representation:

```{r}
srat <- RunUMAP(srat, dims = 1:10, verbose = F)
```

Once clustering is done, active identity is reset to clusters ("seurat_clusters" in metadata). Let's look at cluster sizes.

```{r}
table(srat@meta.data$seurat_clusters)
```

DimPlot uses _UMAP_ by default, with Seurat clusters as _identity_:

```{r fig.align="center"}
DimPlot(srat,label.size = 4,repel = T,label = T)
```

In order to control for clustering resolution and other possible artifacts, we will take a close look at two minor cell populations: 1) dendritic cells (DCs), 2) platelets, aka thrombocytes. Let's visualise two markers for each of this cell type: LILRA4 and TPM2 for DCs, and PPBP and GP1BB for platelets. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
FeaturePlot(srat, features = c("LILRA4", "TPM2", "PPBP", "GP1BB"))
```

Let's visualize other confounders: 
```{r fig.align="center"}
FeaturePlot(srat, features = "Doublet_score") & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
FeaturePlot(srat, features = "percent.mt") & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
FeaturePlot(srat, features = "nFeature_RNA") & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

Let's remove the cells that did not pass QC and compare plots. We can now see much more defined clusters. Our filtered dataset now contains 8824 cells - so approximately 12% of cells were removed for various reasons. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
DimPlot(srat,label.size = 4,repel = T,label = T)
srat <- subset(srat, subset = QC == 'Pass')
DimPlot(srat,label.size = 4,repel = T,label = T)
``` 

Finally, let's calculate cell cycle scores, as described [here](https://satijalab.org/seurat/archive/v3.1/cell_cycle_vignette.html). This has to be done after normalization and scaling. Seurat has a built-in list, cc.genes (older) and cc.genes.updated.2019 (newer), that defines genes involved in cell cycle. For CellRanger reference GRCh38 2.0.0 and above, use cc.genes.updated.2019 (three genes were renamed: MLF1IP, FAM64A and HN1 became CENPU, PICALM and JPT). For mouse cell cycle genes you can use the solution detailed [here](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/issues/2493). 

```{r}
cc.genes.updated.2019
s.genes <- cc.genes.updated.2019$s.genes
g2m.genes <- cc.genes.updated.2019$g2m.genes

srat <- CellCycleScoring(srat, s.features = s.genes, g2m.features = g2m.genes)
table(srat[[]]$Phase)
```

Let's see if we have clusters defined by any of the technical differences. Mitochnondrial genes show certain dependency on cluster, being much lower in clusters 2 and 12. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
FeaturePlot(srat,features = "percent.mt",label.size = 4,repel = T,label = T)  & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

```{r fig.align="center"}
VlnPlot(srat,features = "percent.mt") & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

Ribosomal protein genes show very strong dependency on the putative cell type! Some cell clusters seem to have as much as 45%, and some as little as 15%. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
FeaturePlot(srat,features = "percent.rb",label.size = 4,repel = T,label = T) & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

```{r fig.align="center"}
VlnPlot(srat,features = "percent.rb") & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

There are also differences in RNA content per cell type. From earlier considerations, clusters 6 and 7 are probably lower quality cells that will disapper when we redo the clustering using the QC-filtered dataset. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
VlnPlot(srat,features = c("nCount_RNA","nFeature_RNA")) & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

Finally, cell cycle score does not seem to depend on the cell type much - however, there are dramatic outliers in each group. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
FeaturePlot(srat,features = c("S.Score","G2M.Score"),label.size = 4,repel = T,label = T)  & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
VlnPlot(srat,features = c("S.Score","G2M.Score")) & theme(plot.title = element_text(size=10))
```

### PART 3. SCTransform normalization and clustering. 

Since we have performed extensive QC with doublet and empty cell removal, we can now apply [SCTransform normalization](https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/sctransform_vignette.html), that was shown to be beneficial for finding rare cell populations by improving signal/noise ratio. Single SCTransform command replaces NormalizeData(), ScaleData(), and FindVariableFeatures(). We will also correct for % MT genes and cell cycle scores. 

```{r}
srat <- SCTransform(srat, method = "glmGamPoi", ncells = 8824, 
                    vars.to.regress = c("percent.mt","S.Score","G2M.Score"), verbose = F)
srat
```

After this let's do standard PCA, UMAP, and clustering. Note that SCT is the active assay now. It is conventional to use more PCs with SCTransform; the exact number can be adjusted depending on your dataset. 

```{r fig.align="center"}
srat <- RunPCA(srat, verbose = F)
srat <- RunUMAP(srat, dims = 1:30, verbose = F)
srat <- FindNeighbors(srat, dims = 1:30, verbose = F)
srat <- FindClusters(srat, verbose = F)
table(srat[[]]$seurat_clusters)
DimPlot(srat, label = T)
```

It is very important to set clusters correctly. Let's check the markers of smaller cell populations we have mentioned before - namely, platelets and dendritic cells. Let's also try another color scheme - just to show how it can be done.  

```{r fig.align="center",warning=F,message=F}
FeaturePlot(srat,"PPBP") & scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral")))
FeaturePlot(srat,"LILRA4") & scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral")))
```

We can see there's a cluster of platelets located between clusters 6 and 14, that has not been identified. Increasing clustering resolution in `FindClusters` to 2 would help separate the platelet cluster (try it!), but also generates too many clusters. 

If need arises, we can separate some clusters manualy. There are also clustering methods geared towards indentification of rare cell populations. Let's try using fewer neighbors in the KNN graph, combined with Leiden algorithm (now default in `scanpy`) and slightly increased resolution: 

```{r fig.align="center"}
srat <- FindNeighbors(srat, dims = 1:30, k.param = 15, verbose = F)
srat <- FindClusters(srat, verbose = F, algorithm = 4, resolution = 0.9)
table(srat[[]]$seurat_clusters)
DimPlot(srat, label = T)
```

We already know that cluster 16 corresponds to platelets, and cluster 15 to dendritic cells. Let's get a very crude idea of what the big cell clusters are.

```{r fig.align="center",warning=F,message=F}
FeaturePlot(srat,"MS4A1") + 
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral"))) + ggtitle("MS4A1: B cells")
FeaturePlot(srat,"LYZ") + 
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral"))) + ggtitle("LYZ: monocytes")
FeaturePlot(srat,"NKG7") + 
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral"))) + ggtitle("NKG7: natural killers")
FeaturePlot(srat,"CD8B") + 
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral"))) + ggtitle("CD8B: CD8 T cells")
FeaturePlot(srat,"IL7R") + 
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral"))) + ggtitle("IL7R: CD4 T cells")
```

We can see better separation of some subpopulations. These will be further addressed in PART 5. 

### PART 4. Differential expression and marker selection.

Differential expression allows us to define gene markers specific to each cluster. By definition it is influenced by how clusters are defined, so it's important to find the correct resolution. If some clusters lack any notable markers, adjust the clustering. It is [recommended](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat/discussions/4032) to do differential expression on RNA assay, and not the SCTransform. Differential expression can be done between two clusters, as well as between a cluster and all other cells. 

First, let's set the active assay back to "RNA", and re-do the normalization and scaling (since we removed a notable fraction of cells that failed QC): 

```{r}
DefaultAssay(srat) <- "RNA"
srat <- NormalizeData(srat)
srat <- FindVariableFeatures(srat, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)
all.genes <- rownames(srat)
srat <- ScaleData(srat, features = all.genes)
```

The following function allows to find markers for every cluster by comparing it to all remaining cells, while reporting only the positive ones. There are many tests that can be used to define markers, including a very fast and intuitive [tf-idf](https://constantamateur.github.io/2020-04-10-scDE/). By default, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test is used. This takes a while - take few minutes to make coffee or a cup of tea!

```{r warning = F,message = F}
all.markers <- FindAllMarkers(srat, only.pos = T, min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25)
```

Let's take a quick glance at the markers. 

```{r}
dim(all.markers)
table(all.markers$cluster)
top3_markers <- as.data.frame(all.markers %>% group_by(cluster) %>% top_n(n = 3, wt = avg_log2FC))
top3_markers
```

Some markers are less informative than others. For detailed dissection, it might be good to do differential expression between subclusters (see below). 

### PART 5. Cell type annotation using SingleR.

Given the markers that we've defined, we can mine the literature and identify each observed cell type (it's probably the easiest for PBMC). However, we can try automaic annotation with SingleR is workflow-agnostic (can be used with Seurat, SCE, etc). Detailed signleR manual with advanced usage can be found [here](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/SingleRBook/).

Let's get reference datasets from celldex package. Note that there are two cell type assignments, `label.main` and `label.fine`:

```{r warning=F,message=F}
hpca.ref <- celldex::HumanPrimaryCellAtlasData()
dice.ref <- celldex::DatabaseImmuneCellExpressionData()
monaco.ref <- celldex::MonacoImmuneData()
```

Let's convert our Seurat object to single cell experiment (SCE) for convenience. After this, using `SingleR` becomes very easy: 

```{r}
sce <- as.SingleCellExperiment(srat)
sce

hpca.main <- SingleR(test = sce,assay.type.test = 1,ref = hpca.ref,labels = hpca.ref$label.main)
hpca.fine <- SingleR(test = sce,assay.type.test = 1,ref = hpca.ref,labels = hpca.ref$label.fine)
dice.main <- SingleR(test = sce,assay.type.test = 1,ref = dice.ref,labels = dice.ref$label.main)
dice.fine <- SingleR(test = sce,assay.type.test = 1,ref = dice.ref,labels = dice.ref$label.fine)
monaco.main <- SingleR(test = sce,assay.type.test = 1,ref = monaco.ref,labels = monaco.ref$label.main)
monaco.fine <- SingleR(test = sce,assay.type.test = 1,ref = monaco.ref,labels = monaco.ref$label.fine)
```

Let's see the summary of general cell type annotations. These match our expectations (and each other) reasonably well. 

```{r}
table(hpca.main$pruned.labels)
table(dice.main$pruned.labels)
table(monaco.main$pruned.labels)
```

Finer cell type annotations are harder to achieve; as you can see, many of these do not match: 

```{r}
table(hpca.fine$pruned.labels)
table(dice.fine$pruned.labels)
table(monaco.fine$pruned.labels)
```

Let's add the annotations to the Seurat object metadata so we can use them: 

```{r}
srat@meta.data$hpca.main   <- hpca.main$pruned.labels
srat@meta.data$dice.main   <- dice.main$pruned.labels
srat@meta.data$monaco.main <- monaco.main$pruned.labels
srat@meta.data$hpca.fine   <- hpca.fine$pruned.labels
srat@meta.data$dice.fine   <- dice.fine$pruned.labels
srat@meta.data$monaco.fine <- monaco.fine$pruned.labels
```

Finally, let's visualize the fine-grained annotations.

```{r fig.align="center"}
srat <- SetIdent(srat, value = "hpca.fine")
DimPlot(srat, label = T , repel = T, label.size = 3) + NoLegend()
srat <- SetIdent(srat, value = "dice.fine")
DimPlot(srat, label = T , repel = T, label.size = 3) + NoLegend()
srat <- SetIdent(srat, value = "monaco.fine")
DimPlot(srat, label = T , repel = T, label.size = 3) + NoLegend()
```

Comparing the labels obtained from the three sources, we can see many interesting discrepancies. Sorthing those out requires manual curation. However, many informative assignments can be seen. 

For example, small cluster 17 is repeatedly identified as plasma B cells. This distinct subpopulation displays markers such as CD38 and CD59.

```{r fig.align="center",warning=F,message=F}
FeaturePlot(srat,"CD38") + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral")))
FeaturePlot(srat,"CD59") + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral")))
```

Similarly, cluster 13 is identified to be MAIT cells. Literature suggests that blood MAIT cells are characterized by high expression of CD161 (KLRB1), and chemokines like CXCR6. This indeed seems to be the case: 


```{r fig.align="center",warning=F,message=F}
FeaturePlot(srat,"KLRB1") + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral")))
FeaturePlot(srat,"CXCR6") + scale_colour_gradientn(colours = rev(brewer.pal(n = 11, name = "Spectral")))
```

In general, even simple example of PBMC shows how complicated cell type assignment can be, and how much effort it requires. A detailed book on how to do cell type assignment / label transfer with `singleR` [is available](https://bioconductor.org/books/3.12/SingleRBook/).
